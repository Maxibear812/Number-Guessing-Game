# Number-Guessing-Game
A beginner-level project where the user inputs a number range and tries to guess the right number in the least amount of guesses. 

To use: 
  1. Download the program file from this repository. Click the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP." Extract the file once it's downloaded to a desired location on your computer. 
  2. Open a terminal window.
     a. For Windows, "Win + R", type "cmd" and press enter.
     b. For Linux, either search "Terminal" in System Applications, or use "Ctrl + Alt + T."
  3. Navigate to the file directory/location.
  4. Run the program using the "python" command.
  5. Revel in the simple joy.

Here are the rules: 
1. The user is prompted to input a positive integer, which sets the upper limit of the range for the game.
2. The game generates a random number between 0 and the user-inputted upper limit (inclusive).
3. The user is then prompted to make a guess by inputting a number.
4. If the user's guess is not a valid integer, they are prompted to try again.
5. If the user's guess is higher than the random number, they are given a hint that their guess was too high.
6. If the user's guess is lower than the random number, they are given a hint that their guess was too low.
7. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the random number.
8. Once the user wins, the game displays the number of guesses it took to win.

Any contributions or suggested improvements to this game are welcome, especially from beginners looking to test their programming skills!
